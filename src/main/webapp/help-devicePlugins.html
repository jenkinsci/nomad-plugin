    The device stanza is used to create both a scheduling and runtime requirement that the given task has access to the specified devices. A device is a hardware device that is attached to the node and may be made available to the task. Examples are GPUs, FPGAs, and TPUs. Currently this plugin only supports adding a device and setting its count. see more at <a
